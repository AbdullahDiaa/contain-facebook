# Youtube Container

**Prevent Youtube from tracking your visits to other websites**

Youtube Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Youtube from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use Youtube while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Youtube Container work?

The Add-on keeps Youtube in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Youtube and deletes the cookies that Youtube uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit Youtube, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to Youtube within its container.  When browsing outside the container, Youtube won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your Youtube identity.

## How do I enable Youtube Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Youtube Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/youtube-container/). This will log you out of Youtube and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Youtube and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the Youtube Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of Youtube or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Youtube Container

## How does this affect Youtube’s features?

Youtube Containers prevents Youtube from linking your activity on other websites to your Youtube identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### “Like” buttons and embedded Youtube comments on other websites.

Because you are logged into Youtube only in the Container, “Like” buttons and embedded Youtube comments on other websites will not work.

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Youtube

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Youtube will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Youtube completely?

This add-on does not prevent Youtube from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Youtube still will have access to everything that you do while you are on youtube.com or on the Youtube app, including your Youtube comments, photo uploads, likes, and any data you share with Youtube connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Youtube activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Youtube settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Youtube. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
